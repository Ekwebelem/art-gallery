          Arne Glimcher and I have a lot in common. We both understand that the art world is often perceived as a mysterious place, a distant universe, or a way to get rich. It has also been considered by many to be an exclusive and elitist society. However, with the innovation of technology, the internet, and the growth of international art fairs, much progress has been made in demystifying this wonderful and creative world and introducing its many players, including artists, museums, cultural institutions, media, curators, fairs, auction houses, and of course, art galleries. I have owned and directed my art gallery for 22 years. My position has provided me with a wealth of experience and professional insights to be able to explain the important role and purpose of a gallery within the art world.
          This article is dedicated to all those who told me and continue to say, "Your job is so wonderful. You make so much money promoting beautiful art to beautiful people." This is a wonderful perception - but there is so much more to the reality.
